# DMI Hero UI

Hi! This project is a modern, animated hero section built with Next.js and React. My goal was to create a visually engaging and clean landing experience that feels both professional and inviting.

## ‚ú® What You See

When you open the app, you're greeted by a bold hero section:
- At the top, there's a prominent DMI logo with a soft shadow, giving it a sense of depth.
- Just below, three red dots act as a subtle indicator, adding a touch of motion and focus.
- The main headline reads "Design Made Intelligent," with the word "Intelligent" highlighted in a vibrant red to draw attention.
- A short sub-headline explains the value: "From brand kit to launch-ready content, websites & apps ‚Äî powered by AI."
- Two call-to-action buttons invite you to try the demo or join the waitlist, with smooth hover and tap animations for a tactile feel.

## üé® The Animation

The background isn't static‚Äîit features a smooth, animated red-to-white gradient that gently shifts back and forth. This is powered by Framer Motion, creating a dynamic, modern look without being distracting. The animation helps the hero section stand out and gives the page a sense of life and movement.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Next.js** for the app framework
- **React** for building UI components
- **Framer Motion** for all the animations, including the background and button effects
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling (with some custom color classes for the DMI red)

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run the project locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

I built this hero section to be clean, modern, and easy to extend. If you want to customize the look or animation, check out the `components/AnimatedRedGradientBg.tsx` and `components/HeroSection.tsx` files. Enjoy!
