# DMI Hero UI

Hi! This project is a modern, animated hero section built with Next.js and React. My goal was to create a visually engaging and clean landing experience that feels both professional and inviting.

## What You See

When you open the app, you're greeted by a bold hero section:
- At the top, there's a prominent DMI logo with a soft shadow, giving it a sense of depth.
- Just below, three red dots act as a subtle indicator, adding a touch of motion and focus.
- The main headline reads "Design Made Intelligent," with the word "Intelligent" highlighted in a vibrant red to draw attention.
- A short sub-headline explains the value: "From brand kit to launch-ready content, websites & apps — powered by AI."
- Two call-to-action buttons invite you to try the demo or join the waitlist, with smooth hover and tap animations for a tactile feel.

## The Animation

The background isn't static—it features a smooth, animated red-to-white gradient that gently shifts back and forth. This is powered by Framer Motion, creating a dynamic, modern look without being distracting. The animation helps the hero section stand out and gives the page a sense of life and movement.

##  Tech Stack

- **Next.js** for the app framework
- **React** for building UI components
- **Framer Motion** for all the animations, including the background and button effects
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling (with some custom color classes for the DMI red)
